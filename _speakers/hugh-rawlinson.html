	<h3>Javascript and Music: A tale of many scary noises</h3>
	<h4>Track TBC</h4>
	<p class="desc"><em>A look at Javascript as an interface for musical interaction. Musical performance with programming languages has been around in various forms since the 1960s, and has evolved into a wide variety of different paradigms. Focusing specifically on live-coding, a musical performance practice involving writing code that generates music live in front of an audience, I will take a look at the various tools used to support this performance practice in Javascript, and the musical direction the language steers the performer in. I'm currently working on tools to enable musical interaction from within JS, which I will demonstrate throughout the talk - expect beats!</em></p>
