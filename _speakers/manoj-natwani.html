	<h3>Winning at Hackathons</h3>
	<h4>Lightning</h4>
	<p class="desc"><em>Hackathons are about learning, building and sharing. I'll explain to attendees the true benefits of attending hackathons and how to make the most out of them by using plenty of fun examples from my experience. My theory is that there is an unbelievable amount of hidden benefits of spending a weekend hacking on something new while learning new things with a bunch of smart people. I've attended over 30 hackathons in the last 3 years and have had plenty of success in them too, eventually leading to being named the Kanye West of hackathons. However the real success is in all the hidden benefits. The things not mentioned on websites or talked about enough. Everything from visiting new cities, to learning how to work with different types of people, to even getting the opportunity to present in-front of bunch of strangers brings a mountain of opportunity to improve yourself. It's amazing how it's even possible within a 24hr period. I'm looking to give a really fun and motivating talk to let people take a step back and look at all the benefits of attending hackathons and how consciously trying to make the most out of the 24hrs can really amplify what you get out of it.</em></p>
