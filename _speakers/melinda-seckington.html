	<h3>How and Why We Run Internal Hackdays</h3>
	<h4>Track 2</h4>
	<p class="desc"><em>There are a lot of external hackdays happening around the UK nowadays, but how do you run one internally at a company for just your employees/colleagues? This talk looks at the differences between organizing external hackdays vs internal ones, the things that need to be considered when organizing an internal hackday and how to get everyone in your company involved (beyond just the developers).</em></p>
