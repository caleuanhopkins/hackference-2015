	<h3>A little about Nicolas...</h3>
	<p class="desc">Nicolas is a Hacker in Residence at 3scale living between Barcelona and San Francisco. He built his first website in 2000 using Microsoft Word, and since them did not stop learning about programming. Nicolas has built many projects around APIs using JS stack like APIs.io or APIbunny. His last passion is around Slack and building bots for Slack. When not working you have a good chance to find him hacking on side projects or enjoying a good craft beer. And of course, as he is French, frog and snails are part of his daily diet!</p>
