	<h3>The Value of Open Source</h3>
	<h4>Track 1</h4>
	<p class="desc"><em>Open Source is undoubtably valuable and has a strong intrinsic worth. But where does this value exist? Does the value lie in the software produced, or somewhere else? How could Open Sourcing your software benefit you as a Developer? In this talk weâ€™ll explore the main benefits of Open Source, how it can benefit you and how it can lead to better software. We will also dive into how to get involved in the Open Source Community, and building a community around your software!</em></p>
