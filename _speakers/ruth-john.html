<h3>A Journey Through Browser API Space &amp; Time</h3>
<h4>Track 1</h4>
<p class="desc"><em>More browser APIs seem to be cropping up daily, it’s hard to keep track of what’s what and which is which. Don’t panic, Ruth takes us on a tour of what’s past, what’s present and what the future holds, so you can level up and feel a lot calmer about what’s on the event horizon. All this with plenty of 80's cartoons and a browser powered audio/visual show to boot. You won't want to miss this!</em></p>
